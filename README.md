# GroupPreferenceLanguages

Welcome to this starting app!

The purpose of this application is to handle a system of pilgrims and groups where they can be assigned.
A not very complex mix algorithm will form groups depending on their leadership (they are leaders/animators), and the languages they spoke.
All this flow will be on live, meaning that the user can input a pilgrim and add they to a group using the mix algorithm.

###Capabilities
- Saving pilgrims on a database.
- Saving groups on a database.
- Using an algorithm to determine a possible mix of all the pilgrims. You can use it to start a new mix or to start mixing from the actual state.
- Show the list of added pilgrims and the group they are assigned to.
